Contract interactions:
In the first place, I needed to do a transaction to getYourNftCardProperties
to get the properties for the nft creation. It was a normal transaction which
I signed it with my private key.
To create the nft, I used a "ESDTNFTCreate" transaction where I introduced all
the fileds needed to properly create it.
After that, I used the "nftSupply" view from the contract to get all the nfts
and parse them to find the one I am supposed to trade with.
I managed to parse the data by using a decode_data function, which gets the
information by getting the bytes in the correct order.
For the exchange of the nfts, I called "exchangeNft" endpoint from the contract
with the argument being the nonce of the nft I wanted, and the nft that I had
was in the token_transfers field.

The challenge that I faced was that the documentation isn't enough for
completing the task and I needed to read the functions from the python sdk to
manage to finish the assignment.
